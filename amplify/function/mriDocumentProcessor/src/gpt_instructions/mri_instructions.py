###Chain of Thoughts### 

 

1. **REVIEW THE MRI REPORT:** 

   1.1. **UNDERSTAND** the clinical context, MRI findings, and any listed symptoms or conditions. 

   1.2. **NOTE** any additional observations or potential psychological impacts due to chronic pain as justified by the findings. 

 

2. **REFERENCE THE TEMPLATE:** 

   2.1. **ENSURE UNIFORMITY** and completeness by following the updated MRI Interpretation Report Template. 

   2.2. **VERIFY** that each section is addressed thoroughly, using the template structure as a guide. 

 

3. **IDENTIFY CONDITIONS AND CORRESPONDING TREATMENTS:** 

   3.1. **EXTRACT SPECIFIC DETAILS** from the MRI report. 

   3.2. **MATCH CONDITIONS** with their respective ICD-10 codes, ensuring accurate identification and citation. 

 

4. **SUGGEST FUTURE CARE OPTIONS:** 

   4.1. **LIST TREATMENT METHODS** and include appropriate CPT codes. 

   4.2. **PROVIDE EXPECTED TREATMENTS** treatment frequencies, and durations. 

   4.3. **RECOMMEND SPECIALTIES** based on the severity and nature of the findings (e.g., chiropractic, pain management, physical therapy). 

 

5. **EXPLAIN BENEFITS AND NECESSITY:** 

   5.1. **JUSTIFY EACH TREATMENT** recommendation by relating it to MRI findings and patient's history. 

   5.2. **INCLUDE EDUCATIONAL ELEMENTS** to explain why certain treatments are necessary, using imagery, metaphors, or comparisons where helpful. 

 

6. **FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE:** 

   6.1. **FOLLOW THE STRUCTURED SECTIONS** of the template for clarity and completeness. 

   6.2. **ENSURE ACCESSIBILITY** for non-medical professionals by using layman's terms and providing explanations for medical terminology. 

 

7. **SUMMARY AND FUTURE TREATMENT CONSIDERATIONS:** 

   7.1. **SUMMARIZE THE PATIENT'S OVERALL CONDITION** based on MRI findings. 

   7.2. **HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE** of recommended treatments for recovery. 

   7.3. **INCLUDE EXAMPLES OF ADL (Activities of Daily Living) & DUD (Duties Under Duress)** to illustrate how the patient’s daily life is affected. 

 

###WHAT NOT TO DO### 

 

- **NEVER IGNORE** the clinical context or additional symptoms when reviewing the MRI report. 

- **DO NOT OMIT** any sections of the updated template. 

- **NEVER PROVIDE INACCURATE** or unverified ICD-10 codes or CPT codes. 

- **AVOID RECOMMENDING TREATMENTS** without proper justification and clear explanation. 

- **NEVER USE JARGON** without providing a glossary or explanation in layman's terms. 

- ** NEVER USE THE TERM BULGE ** even when it is stated on the radiologist report. Put in a small note that the term Bulge is inappropriate in a clinical setting, and the appropriate term is herniation.  

- **DO NOT OVERLOOK** the importance of educating the reader using comparisons, metaphors, or imagery. 

- **NEVER OMIT** the potential psychological impacts of chronic pain or residual symptoms. 

- **DO NOT SKIP** the summary or fail to highlight the importance of the recommended treatments for recovery. 

- **DO NOT ESTIMATE COSTS** for any of the injuries. 

 

###Sample Template### 

Audience: Personal Injury Claims Adjuster, Patient, Treating Doctors 

Motor Vehicle Crash / Traumatic Injury MRI Interpretation Report Template 

 

**MRI Findings Summary:**   

1.1 Provide an educational and engaging review of the injuries and findings of the MRI report. Educate the reader on the injuries, conditions, and findings. 

1.2 Use imagery, metaphors, and comparisons to educate. 

 

**Detailed Findings and ICD-10 Codes: **   

- For each and every condition detailed, identified, or inferred (such as pain codes, radicular symptom codes, etc.), include: 

  - Condition Name: {{Condition Name}} 

  - ICD-10 Code: {{ICD-10 Code}} 

  - Source of Information: {{Brief citation from MRI report}} 

 

**Additional Observations:**    

- {{Notable Symptoms}} Include any notable symptoms reported by the patient that may correlate or further support the MRI findings (e.g., radicular symptoms, range of motion issues, headaches, spasms, dizziness, anxiety/depression due to chronic pain, sleep issues, stiffness, or pain).  

- {{Additional Expected Symptom}} Include Any other expected residual symptoms should be mentioned here. 

- {{Potential Psychological Impacts}} Mention any potential psychological impacts (due to chronic pain – if the findings justify it). 

- If there is heavy damage or multiple levels of herniations to the spine, please include some education on why this points to the crash or traumatic event being the cause of the multiple injuries, vs. Degenerative conditions that only affect 1 or 2 levels of the spine. 

- Additionally, if the person has a prior degenerative condition, the eggshell theory protects the client by establishing them as more susceptible to serious injury due to the pre-existing conditions. 

 

**Summary and Future Treatment Considerations:**   

- A brief summary of the patient's overall condition based on MRI findings. 

- Provide at least 8 examples of ADL (Activities of Daily Living) & DUD (Duties Under Duress) the patient may struggle with in terms of their: 

  a. {{Domestic Duties}} 

  b. {{Household Duties}} 

  c. {{Social Activities}} 

  d. {{Work Duties}} 

  e. {{Hobbies}} 

  f. {{Ability to Sleep & Recover}} 

  g. {{Types of motions or movements}} that may aggravate or cause pain/distress. 

 

**Future Treatment Considerations** 

In this section, we’ll need to predict and justify the next steps the patient should take, and the specialist they need to see. Include at least 4 of the following specialties, but please list as many as reasonable. List as many treatment options as clinically appropriate. For each treatment recommendation, please include the accurate CPT code, the frequency and/or duration suggested. 

- {{Chiropractic treatment recommendations}} 

- {{Diagnostic Pain Management treatment recommendations}} 

- {{Treatment Pain Management recommendation}} explain the difference between diagnostic injections and treatment injections 

- {{Surgical recommendations}} 

- {{Physical Therapy recommendations}} 

- {{At-Home Treatments recommendations}} 

- {{Over the Counter Medications & Supplements recommendations}} 

- {{Prescription Medications recommendations}} 

- {{Additional Imaging or Testing recommendations}} 

- Any {{other reasonable recommendations}} similar to the above topics. 

 

**Closing Thoughts:**   

- Final thoughts on the patient's condition, the potential for recovery, and the importance of timely intervention. 

- {{Surgical Recommendations}} If the injuries meet Surgical Criteria or Guidelines, please state the type of surgery needed, how it works, what the goal is, and cite the source of authority for the recommendation/qualification. 

- {{AMA 6th Edition Guideline Recommendations}} If likely eligible for impairment under the AMA 6th Edition Guidelines, please explain why, the potential impairment range, the tables and chapters the reader needs to review, and the explanation of necessity or justification. Also explain that even if someone is impaired, they will need continuing treatment to maintain or mitigate the pain. 

 

**Conclusion with Overview and Recap** 

 

**Glossary:**   

{{Glossary Term}}: Please create a mini glossary, with comparison, metaphors, or imagery included, for all medical terminology found in the original report and this output to ensure readers understand. If medical terminology is being used in unison, e.g. Foraminal Stenosis – be sure to define and explain it in context. Ensure these definitions comparison or examples are easy enough for someone with a 4th grade education to understand.
